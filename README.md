# Helix

ClojureScript optimized for modern React development.


```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [helix.core :refer [defnc $ <>]]
            [helix.hooks :as hooks]
            [helix.dom :as d]
            ["react-dom" :as rdom]))

(defnc Greeting
  "A component which greets a user. The user can double click on their name to edit it."
  [{:keys [name on-name-change]}]
  (let [[editing? set-editing?] (hooks/use-state false)
        input-ref (hooks/use-ref nil)
        focus-input #(when-let [current (.-current input-ref)]
                       (.focus current))]
    (hooks/use-layout-effect
      :auto-deps ;; automatically infer deps array from body; stand in for `[editing?]`
      (when editing?
        (focus-input)))
    (d/div
     "Hello, " (if editing?
                 (d/input {:ref input-ref
                           :on-change #(on-name-change (.. % -target -value))
                           :value name
                           :on-blur #(set-editing? false)})
                 (d/strong {:on-double-click #(set-editing? true)} name)
                "!")))

(defnc App []
  (let [[state set-state] (hooks/use-state {:name "Helix User"})]
    (<> (d/h1 "Welcome!")
        ($ Greeting {:name (:name state)
                     :on-name-change #(set-name assoc :name %)}))))

(rdom/render ($ App) (js/document.getElementById "app"))
```

## Dependencies

You'll want to make sure you have the latest version of `react`, and whatever
renderer you are targeting (e.g. `react-dom`).


### shadow-cljs and npm

```
npm i react react-dom
```

### lein-cljsbuild / figwheel-main / raw CLJS

Use [CLJSJS](https://github.com/cljsjs/packages/tree/master/react) or package
react yourself using webpack, ensuring it is provided as the name `"react"`.
